# Multimodal RAG Application for Vetcare  ü©∫ üê∂

This project implements a Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system using FastAPI, LangChain, and OpenAI. The app serves as a vet doctor assistant that analyzes a dog's health based on provided text, images, and tables.

## Introduction

The Multimodal RAG App integrates a Language Model (LLM) with a retrieval system to provide detailed and context-aware answers to user queries. It can process text, images, and tables to formulate responses based on the retrieved documents.

## Dataset

The dataset is a collection of veterinary periodontal documents gathered from various sources on the internet. These documents include text descriptions, images, and tables related to the health and treatment of dogs' periodontal conditions. The comprehensive nature of the dataset allows the system to provide well-informed and accurate responses to user queries.

## Key Features and Processes

### Retrieve Relevant Documents using FAISS and OpenAI Embeddings

**Objective**: Efficiently retrieve documents that are most relevant to a given query using FAISS and OpenAI embeddings.

- **FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search)**: FAISS is a library developed by Facebook AI Research for efficient similarity search and clustering of dense vectors. It is designed to handle large datasets and perform nearest neighbor searches quickly.

**Process**:
1. **Data Preparation**: Convert documents (text, images, tables) into dense vector representations (embeddings) using OpenAI embeddings.
2. **Index Creation**: Store these vector representations in a FAISS index.
3. **Query Processing**: Convert the user query into a vector representation.
4. **Similarity Search**: Use FAISS to perform a nearest neighbor search to find the most similar documents to the query based on vector distance.

### Process and Analyze Multimodal Data (Text, Images, Tables)

**Objective**: Handle and analyze different types of data (text, images, tables) to create a comprehensive context for generating responses.

- **Multimodal Data**: Multimodal data includes different types of data formats such as:
  - **Text**: Articles, reports, descriptions, etc.
  - **Images**: Photos, diagrams, charts, etc.
  - **Tables**: Structured data in tabular form.

**Process**:
1. **Data Embedding**: Convert each type of data into embeddings (vector representations) using suitable models.
2. **Context Building**: Combine embeddings from various data types to create a unified context for analysis.
3. **Data Handling**: Use metadata to differentiate and process each type of data accordingly.

### Generate Detailed and Accurate Responses using GPT-4

**Objective**: Use the GPT-4 model to generate detailed and context-aware responses based on the retrieved and processed multimodal data.

- **GPT-4 (Generative Pre-trained Transformer 4)**: GPT-4 is a large language model developed by OpenAI that can understand and generate human-like text based on the input context.

**Process**:
1. **Prompt Creation**: Formulate a prompt that includes the combined context from retrieved documents and the user‚Äôs query.
2. **Model Inference**: Pass the prompt to the GPT-4 model to generate a response.
3. **Result Interpretation**: Extract and format the response generated by the model.

### FastAPI-Based Web Interface with a Responsive Design

**Objective**: Provide a user-friendly web interface for interacting with the Multimodal RAG system using FastAPI and responsive web design techniques.

- **FastAPI**: FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance) web framework for building APIs with Python 3.6+ based on standard Python type hints.

**Process**:
1. **API Endpoints**: Define endpoints to handle user queries and return responses.
2. **HTML Templates**: Use Jinja2 templates to render the web interface.
3. **Static Files**: Include CSS and JavaScript for a responsive and interactive user experience.


## Installation and Setup

**Process**:
1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the repository from GitHub using the URL `https://github.com/yourusername/Multimodal_RAG_VetCare.git` and navigate into the project directory.
2. **Install Dependencies**: Install the required dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file.
3. **Set Up Environment Variables**: Create a `.env` file in the project root directory and add your OpenAI API key in the format `OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key`.
4. **Run the Application**: Start the FastAPI server. This will start the FastAPI server, and you can access the application at [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000).
